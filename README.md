# kočakote

Kočakote is an experimental, constructed language made by Jonatan Nordentoft in 2016 with the intent of creating a condensed ~~means~~ *mess* of communication by getting rid of unnecessary fillers such as prepositions and making pronunciation as easy as possible while still keeping an interesting sound to the language. Kočakote is not meant to be used seriously, but I won't stop you if you do. This repo contains [the website for the language](https://jonn.me/kocakote).
